There are 38 lines drawn each frame. It runs 38 times?

What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?
The first 10 defines the variable x as being equal to 10, the second 10 tells the loop to check that it is ten pixels to the left of the right side of the canvas, and the third 10 increases x by ten each loop.
