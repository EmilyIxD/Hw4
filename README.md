Homework for week 4

How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?
There are 38 lines drawn each frame. It runs 38 times?

What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?
The first 10 defines the variable x as being equal to 10 (where to start), the second 10 tells the loop to check that it is ten pixels to the left of the right side of the canvas (how long to repeat), and the third 10 increases x by ten each loop (the change happening each loop).

How many times does the loop body run each frame, once the x and y arrays are full?
The loop runs continuously. It runs whenever your mouse moves and it has to redraw the circles. 
What are two ways of increasing the spacing between rings?
Increasing the number that var i is equal to. Another way is to increase the "10" in the increment. 
How can you make the ellipse trail longer?
If you change "10" in the increment to a smaller number (for example, i = i + 1), then more rings will be added and you will have a longer trail following your mouse.
