Homework for week 4

How many lines are drawn each frame? In other words, how often does the for loop run?
There are 38 lines drawn each frame. It runs 38 times?

What do the first, second, and third appearances of the number 10 do in the code?
The first 10 tells the loop where to draw the first line (on the left side), the second 10 tells the loop to draw the next line ten pixels to the left of the right side of the canvas, and the third 10 says to keep drawing the lines ten pixels apart from each other.
